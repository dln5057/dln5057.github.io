title: About Me
description: I have always been an achiever; be it academics or professional life or sports or any other field in my life. I believe in success through hard work and dedication. I like to think about George Bernard Shaw's quote "Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself." I believe that through creativity and hard work, every challenge will be more enjoyable.  I enjoy life to the fullest and love humor. I am a progressive thinker and enjoy learning new things.

					<h3>Education</h3>
				</header>
				<p> I have always had a passion for technology, and after finishing my four years at Penn State University with a bachelors in Communications, I wasn’t fulfilled. I decided to embark on my coding journey. I attended a software engineering program at the University of Scranton to familiarize myself with computer science and data structures. As my passion continued to grow, I enrolled in a 24 week bootcamp dedicated to designing and building web applications. I became certified as a Full Stack Web Developer and haven’t looked back since.</p>

				<p>They say "Looks great, feels great." With developing, I like to abide by that in the design. If it looks right, feels right, and functions right, it can feel great. This leads to good positive interactions.</p>
